# Reference to the EXISTING resource group (created by the network project).
# This project never creates or destroys the resource group, the VNet, or

# attaches new resources (NIC, VM) into the subnet whose ID is passed in via
# var.app_subnet_id.

# Disposable SSH key pair for the management VM.
#
# Azure's API requires SOME authentication method to create a Linux VM -
# there is no fully "keyless" creation path. Since this VM has no network
# path reachable over SSH (private subnet, no public IP, NSG-Private denies
# all inbound), this key is never used for actual access.
#
# The private key is intentionally NOT written to disk - it only exists
# inside the Terraform state file for this project.
#
# Access to this VM is exclusively via:
#   - az vm run-command (Azure VM Agent, over the ARM control plane)
#   - Azure Serial Console
